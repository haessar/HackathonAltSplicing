jbrowse_env/			- Contains small demo files and a config.json for launching JBrowse 2 with jbrowse-plugin-bedfeaturecoloring installed. Due to file size constraints I've only included two of the smaller tagged BAM files. To repeat the full analysis, copy over more BAM files into jbrowse-env/ and add them as additional tracks to the config.json.
			- Launch jbrowse-web locally on port 3000 (default)
			- Navigate to jbrowse-env/ and run command `npx serve . --cors -p 3001`
