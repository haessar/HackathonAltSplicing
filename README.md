### ðŸ”€ Branching Strategy

As there will be lots of us working feverishly in the same repo, I recommend we use **feature branches** for all development work rather than `main`.  

- Create a new branch from `main` for each new feature or fix (perhaps to work on a GitHub issue):  
  ```bash
  git checkout -b your-feature-name
  ```
- Once you're happy with changes, open a pull request to merge into `main` and someone can review them.

- This will help prevent conflicts, support collaboration, and maintain a clean commit history.
